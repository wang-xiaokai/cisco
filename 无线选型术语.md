#### Horizontal and Elevation Planes（水平和垂直平面）

A 3D plot is difficult to portray in 2D, especially if the shape is irregular. Most physical antennas aren’t perfect, so their radiation pattern isn’t a perfect sphere. The 3D plot can be divided into two orthogonal planes to show the two perspectives formed from the plot.

The image below shows the sphere divided by two orthogonal planes. The XY plane lies flat along the horizon. It is called the H or horizontal azimuth plane and often gives a top-down perspective of the radiation pattern across the center of the antenna. The XZ plane lies vertically along the sphere’s elevation. It is called the E or elevation plane, giving a side view of the same radiation pattern.

 XY平面代表是H or horizontal平面，XZ平面代表是E or elevation平面

#### Antenna Gain（天线增益）
Antennas amplify or add gain to the signal by forming the RF energy as it is propagated into free space. An antenna’s gain measures how effectively it can direct Rf signals in a particular direction.

An isotropic antenna radiates RF energy in all directions equally, so it cannot concentrate the RF energy in one direction. The antenna’s gain in dBi is measured in relation to an isotropic antenna. An isotropic antenna’s gain is 10log10(1), or 0 dBi.

The image below shows the isotropic antenna, the omni directional antenna, and the directional antenna radiation patterns and gain values. The gain is lower for omnidirectional antennas, which cover a large area. The gain is higher for directional antennas, which are purposed to cover smaller areas.

Isotropic（各向同性天线，0 dBi）：理论上的理想天线，在所有方向上均匀辐射信号，因此是一个完整的球形分布。
Omnidirectional（全向天线，+4 dBi）：全向天线通过将信号集中在水平面（水平方向）来增加增益。在垂直方向上，信号被压缩，导致中心点（垂直方向）没有信号。这种辐射模式就像一个“甜甜圈”，中间是空的。
Directional（定向天线，+12 dBi）：定向天线通过更加集中信号在特定方向（水平和垂直都集中）来实现更高增益。因此，它的辐射模式看起来更像一个扁平的盘状，中心区域的信号进一步缩小或消失，集中在一个窄方向上

#### Beamwidth（波束宽度）
The antenna’s beamwidth measures the antenna’s focus and is usually expressed in degrees. The beamwidth is calculated by finding the plot’s strongest point, typically on the outer ring. The plot is then moved in either direction until the value drops by 3 dB, signifying the point at which the signal is half its maximum power.

Each 3 dB point is intersected by a line from the plot’s center. The angle between the two lines is then determined. For example, the image below shows an H plane beamwidth of 20 degrees and an E plane beamwidth of 50 degrees.

蓝色线表示天线的辐射方向图，展示了在不同角度的信号强度分布。-3 dB 点是指辐射方向图上，信号强度从峰值（0 dB）下降到 -3 dB 的两个位置（一个在主波束的左侧，一个在右侧）。
